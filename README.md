# Combined-Search-Algorithm
In this, I implemented the following search algorithms to deliver goods from a starting position S to a destination position D in an undirected weighted graph G:
● Breadth-first search
● Depth-first search
● Uniform-cost search using the amount of fuel needed as cost


Sample Input File:
     BFS
     70
     S
     D
     S: A-20, B-30
     A: S-20, D-60
     B: S-30, D-30
     D: A-60, B-30


Sample Output File:
     S-B-D 10
